Description:
    This package aims at computing the correlation between 2 time-series.
    It performs a non-parametric kernel smoothing (using a common bandwidth) of all underlying componenents required for the computation of a correlation coefficient (i.e. x, y, x^2, y^2, xy).
    An automatic selection procedure for the bandwidth parameter is implemented.
    Gaussian, box and Epanechnikov kernels can be used.
    Both Pearson and Spearman correlation coefficients can be estimated.
