Resubmission in response to review from Victoria Wimmer:

* Add Choi & Shin (2021) in DESCRIPTION.
* Improve documentation (returns more details and use of LaTeX).

V.W. also mentioned "Please ensure that you do not use more than 2 cores in your examples, vignettes, etc.", but to the best of my knowledge, I never use more than 2 cores in the package.
